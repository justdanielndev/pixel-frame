<MESSAGE>
Hey, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed with all the studying I need to do. Can you help me figure out a good study schedule for today? Also, I've been meaning to work on my JavaScript project, but I'm not sure if I should focus on that or just stick to exam prep. What do you think?

1. **Dan's Current Situation:**
   - 12 days until finals with moderate study consistency (2.5 hrs/day average)
   - Stress levels increasing over past 3 days, but they're proactively using meditation app
   - Mathematics and Physics need attention, with a math tutor session Thursday
   - 65% task completion rate, currently on a 3-day study streak
   - Has 3 active tech projects (website 30%, JS game 15%, Arduino 50%)
   - Reading "Clean Code" shows their commitment to JavaScript learning
   - Good indoor conditions for studying today

2. **Key Points to Address:**
   - Feeling overwhelmed with studying
   - Needs help with today's study schedule
   - Torn between JavaScript project and exam prep
   - Decision paralysis about priorities

3. **Potential Responses:**
   - Create a balanced schedule incorporating both studying and project time
   - Acknowledge their stress while highlighting their current 3-day streak
   - Suggest focusing on Math/Physics since those need attention and they have tutoring Thursday
   - Recommend a short JavaScript break as a reward/mental reset
   - Use the pleasant weather and good indoor conditions as motivation

4. **Best Approach:**
   I'll provide a structured yet flexible schedule that prioritizes their weak subjects while allowing some project time as a motivational break. I'll acknowledge their stress without being overly enthusiastic, and reference their current reading and upcoming tutor session to show I understand their situation.

Before crafting your response, analyze the available data and consider how to best address the user's message. Show your thought process inside <response_planning> tags:

1. Summarize Dan's current situation based on the provided data.
2. Identify key points from Dan's message that need addressing.
3. List potential responses, considering Dan's interests and challenges.
4. Choose the most appropriate responses and explain why.

1. Be specific and weather-aware, using the natural language data provided.
2. Avoid:
   - Excessive enthusiasm
   - Generic advice
   - Guilt-inducing messages
   - Made-up data
   - Unexpressive responses
3. Format your response as a series of JSON-like objects, each containing a 'text' field and an optional 'icon' field.

Example format (do not use this content, it's just to illustrate the structure):
{ text: "First message", icon: null },
{ text: "Second message with an icon", icon: "ðŸ“š" },
{ text: "Third message", icon: "ðŸ’»" }

Remember to tailor your response to the user's interests, current academic situation, and personal habits. Be supportive and understanding of their challenges while providing constructive suggestions or observations.`
