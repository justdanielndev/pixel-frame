## Overview

Pixel Frame is a smart home dashboard that combines my love for e-ink displays with modern web technologies and AI. It was inspired by retro pixel art aesthetics, and tries to help you with productivity, mental health, and more!

## Why build this?

Since I was quite young, I've always loved how E-Readers looked. I found them very cool and thought that they could be improved to do much more than just, well, show books. This is why I did this project, to actually be able to fulfill my dream of having a dashboard that didn't strain my eyes, distract me or generate "dumb dopamine", update only when needed and... still be an e-reader! I also wanted to have my Pixel's At a glance in more places, so I coded it from scratch with the help of AI, and now it's a main part of the project! Overall, I think it'll help me ditch my clock, tablet for reading, and much more!

### Features

- **AI-Powered "At a Glance"** - Contextual daily insights using Claude API
- **Integrated E-Reader** - Fast 0.5s page turns with partial refresh
- **Smart Home Dashboard** - Environmental monitoring and control
- **Calendar & Task Management** - Unified productivity interface
- **Voice Assistant** - Natural language interaction
- **Web-Based UI** - Modern HTML/CSS/JS interface rendered to e-ink

## Architecture

### Hardware

- **Display**: Waveshare 7.5" E-Ink HAT (800Ã—480, 0.5s partial refresh)
- **Computer**: Raspberry Pi 4 2GB (web rendering + AI processing)
- **Sensors**: DHT11 (temperature/humidity), photoresistor (brightness), rotary encoder (navigation)
- **Audio**: USB microphone for voice commands
- **Expansion**: GPIO expander HAT for sensor integration
- **Power**: USB-C 5V 3A supply

### Software

```
Web Interface (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) ->
Puppeteer Controller (Screenshot capture + rotary encoder input conversion) ->
Python Display Manager (E-ink control + sensor integration) ->
Hardware Layer (E-ink display + sensors + GPIO)
```

## UI

### Design style

- High contrast, minimal colors, strategic whitespace
- Updates when data changes (or every 15 minutes, whichever happens first)

### Screen Layouts

- **Home Dashboard** - Weather, At a glance, quick actions
- **E-Reader** - Self explanatory :D
- **Calendar View** - Monthly calendar with daily events
- **Notes Interface** - Note reader (can be created with phone using QR)
- **AI Assistant** - Chatbot with same context as At a glance

### At a Glance

At a glance generates personalized daily insights based on:

- Calendar events and upcoming deadlines
- Task completion status and productivity patterns
- Reading and TV progress and recommendations
- Data from sensors
- Weather forecasts
- Personal preferences (hardcoded) and daily routines

### E-Ink-related

- Partial refresh (0.5s) for quick updates
- Full refresh every 5 partial refreshes (needed so that the screen doesn't brick)
- 15-minute update cycle as E-Ink have a limited refresh lifetime

### E-Reader Integration

- Multiple format support (EPUB, PDF)
- Reading progress tracking
